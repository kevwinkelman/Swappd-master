## Logging
You cannot use "System.out.println()" to debug in Android so you have to use Log to see text. 

In your code use "Log.i("String to search by (the tag)", "Message");".

You can find the message in Android Monitor in the bottom left of Android Studio. In the search box next to the dropdown box "Verbose" enter your tag.
